# Trip Planner App - Deployment Guide 🚀

This comprehensive guide will help you deploy your Trip Planner application to both GitHub Pages and Netlify.

## 🌟 Live Demo

The app has been successfully deployed and is accessible at:

- **GitHub Pages**: [https://aswinikalyan30.github.io/PackTogether](https://aswinikalyan30.github.io/PackTogether)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Git
- A GitHub account
- A Netlify account (for Netlify deployment)

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Automated)

GitHub Pages deployment is already configured and working! The app automatically deploys when you push to the repository.

#### How it works:
1. The app is configured with `homepage: "https://aswinikalyan30.github.io/PackTogether"` in `package.json`
2. GitHub Pages serves the built files from the `gh-pages` branch
3. Deployment happens automatically using `gh-pages` package

#### Manual deployment (if needed):
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

### Option 2: Netlify Deployment

#### Method A: Connect GitHub Repository (Recommended)

1. **Sign up/Login to Netlify**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up or login to your account

2. **Import from GitHub**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Select your repository: `aswinikalyan30/PackTogether`
   - Configure build settings:
     - **Base directory**: `trip-planner`
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `trip-planner/build`

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your app
   - You'll get a random URL like `https://amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`

#### Method B: Manual CLI Deployment

1. **Install Netlify CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```
   - This will open a browser window for authentication

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   # For first deployment
   netlify deploy --dir=build --prod

   # For subsequent deployments
   netlify deploy --dir=build --prod
   ```

#### Method C: Drag and Drop

1. Build your project locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Visit [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)

3. Drag and drop the `build` folder to deploy instantly

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

### package.json
The deployment scripts and homepage URL are configured:
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://aswinikalyan30.github.io/PackTogether",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "gh-pages": "^6.2.0"
  }
}
```

### netlify.toml
Netlify configuration for optimal performance:
```toml
[build]
  base = "."
  publish = "build"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
```

## 🔧 Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Test the build locally
npx serve -s build
```

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

### For GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Add your custom domain in the "Custom domain" field
4. GitHub will create a CNAME file in your repository

### For Netlify:
1. Go to your site dashboard
2. Click "Domain settings"
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build fails on deployment**
   - Check that all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
   - Ensure build command runs successfully locally
   - Check for any environment-specific issues

2. **404 errors on refresh**
   - For GitHub Pages: This is expected for SPAs without additional configuration
   - For Netlify: The `netlify.toml` redirects configuration handles this

3. **Assets not loading**
   - Verify the `homepage` field in `package.json` matches your deployment URL
   - Check that build paths are correct

4. **GitHub Pages not updating**
   - Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository for build status
   - Ensure you're pushing to the correct branch
   - Wait a few minutes for propagation
