# Trip Planner App - Deployment Guide 🚀

This comprehensive guide will help you deploy your Trip Planner application to both GitHub Pages and Netlify.

## 🌟 Live Demo

The app has been successfully deployed and is accessible at:

- **GitHub Pages**: [https://aswinikalyan30.github.io/PackTogether](https://aswinikalyan30.github.io/PackTogether)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Git
- A GitHub account
- A Netlify account (for Netlify deployment)

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Automated)

GitHub Pages deployment is already configured and working! The app automatically deploys when you push to the repository.

#### How it works:
1. The app is configured with `homepage: "https://aswinikalyan30.github.io/PackTogether"` in `package.json`
2. GitHub Pages serves the built files from the `gh-pages` branch
3. Deployment happens automatically using `gh-pages` package

#### Manual deployment (if needed):
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

### Option 2: Netlify Deployment

#### Method A: Connect GitHub Repository (Recommended)

1. **Sign up/Login to Netlify**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up or login to your account

2. **Import from GitHub**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Select your repository: `aswinikalyan30/PackTogether`
   - Configure build settings:
     - **Base directory**: `trip-planner`
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `trip-planner/build`

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your app
   - You'll get a random URL like `https://amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`

#### Method B: Manual CLI Deployment

1. **Install dependencies (if not already done)**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**
   ```bash
   npm run netlify:init
   # OR manually login
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run netlify:build
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   # For preview deployment
   npm run netlify:deploy

   # For production deployment
   npm run netlify:deploy:prod
   ```

#### Method C: Local Development with Netlify

```bash
# Start Netlify dev server (with serverless functions support)
npm run netlify:dev
```

#### Method D: Drag and Drop

1. Build your project locally:
   ```bash
   npm run netlify:build
   ```

2. Visit [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)

3. Drag and drop the `build` folder to deploy instantly

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

### For GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Add your custom domain in the "Custom domain" field
4. GitHub will create a CNAME file in your repository

### For Netlify:
1. Go to your site dashboard
2. Click "Domain settings"
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build fails on deployment**
   - Check that all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
   - Ensure build command runs successfully locally: `npm run netlify:build`
   - Check for any environment-specific issues

2. **404 errors on refresh**
   - For GitHub Pages: This is expected for SPAs without additional configuration
   - For Netlify: The `netlify.toml` redirects configuration handles this automatically

3. **Assets not loading**
   - Verify the `homepage` field in `package.json` matches your deployment URL
   - Check that build paths are correct
   - For Netlify: Ensure the `base` and `publish` directories in `netlify.toml` are correct

4. **GitHub Pages not updating**
   - Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository for build status
   - Ensure you're pushing to the correct branch
   - Wait a few minutes for propagation

5. **Netlify build failing**
   - Check that Node.js version is compatible (we've set it to 18 in `netlify.toml`)
   - Verify build command: `npm run netlify:build`
   - Check Netlify build logs for specific error messages
